A long straight wire is located at the origin of an $x y$-coordinate system and is perpendicular to the $x y$-plane. The wire has a current that is directed into the page, as shown in the figure above. Which of the following graphs best represents the magnetic field $\vec{B}$ due to the current as a function of the position $x$ along the $x$-axis? Assume a positive magnetic field to be directed in the $+y$ direction.
