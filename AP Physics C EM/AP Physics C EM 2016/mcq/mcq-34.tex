\begin{questions}\setcounter{question}{33}\question
A particle of charge $+q$ is released from rest at position $B$, which is a distance $2 d$ from the center of a fixed nonconducting sphere that has a charge of $-Q$ distributed uniformly throughout its volume, as shown in the figure above. When the particle reaches position $A$, which is a distance $d$ from the center of the charged sphere, its kinetic energy is $K_{0}$. The same particle is now released from rest at position $C$, which is a distance $4 d$ from the center of the nonconducting sphere. The kinetic energy of the particle when it again reaches position $A$ is
