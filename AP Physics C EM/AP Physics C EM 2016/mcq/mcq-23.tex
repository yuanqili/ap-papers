\begin{questions}\setcounter{question}{22}\question
A long solenoid has 300 loops. The region inside the solenoid has a uniform magnetic field that is directed parallel to the axis of the solenoid. Each loop has an area $2 \times 10^{-4} \unit{m^2}$. The magnetic field decreases at a constant rate from $0.5 \unit{T}$ to zero. What is the time duration for the change in magnetic field if a potential difference of $10 \unit{V}$ is induced between the ends of the solenoid while the field is decreasing?
