Suppose that the magnetic field due to a very long straight wire carrying current $I$ has magnitude $B_{0}$ at a distance $r_{0}$ from the wire. If the wire is bent into a right angle and placed on the $x y$-axes as shown above, the magnitude of the magnetic field at point $P$ on the $x$-axis at a distance of $r_{0}$ from the bend is most nearly
