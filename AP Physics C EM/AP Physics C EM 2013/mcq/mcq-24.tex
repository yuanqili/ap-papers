\begin{questions}\setcounter{question}{23}\question
A thin ring of radius $R$ has charge $+Q$ distributed uniformly around the ring. The center of the ring is at the origin of an $x$-axis perpendicular to the plane of the ring, as shown in the figure above. A point charge $+q$ on the $x$-axis at position $x=R$ is released from rest. What is its kinetic energy when it reaches position $P$ at $x=2 R$ on the $x$-axis?
