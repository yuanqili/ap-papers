\begin{questions}\setcounter{question}{25}\question
A parallel-plate capacitor connected to an ideal battery has charge $+Q$ on its top plate. The energy stored in the capacitor is $U_{C}$. While the capacitor remains connected to the battery, the separation between the two plates is doubled.
Which of the following gives the new charge on the top plate and the new energy stored in the capacitor?

\tabto{0.75cm}\underline{Charge}
\tabto{4.00cm}\underline{Potential Energy}

\begin{choices}
\choice $+2 Q$   \tabto{3.25cm} $2 U_{C}$
\choice $+2 Q$   \tabto{3.25cm} $U_{C} / 2$
\choice $+Q$     \tabto{3.25cm} $U_{C}$
\choice $+Q / 2$ \tabto{3.25cm} $2 U_{C}$
\choice $+Q / 2$ \tabto{3.25cm} $U_{C} / 2$
\end{choices}\end{questions}
