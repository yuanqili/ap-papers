\begin{questions}\setcounter{question}{31}\question
A variable voltage source is connected to an inductor of inductance $L$. The voltage $V$ as a function of time $t$ is given by the equation $V(t)=\beta t^{2}$, where $\beta$ is a constant in units of $\unit{V/s^2}$. The current in the inductor at time $t=0$ is zero. Which of the following equations gives the magnitude of the current in the inductor as a function of time?

\begin{choices}
\choice $I(t)=0$
\choice $I(t)=\dfrac{2 \beta}{L} t$
\choice $I(t)=\dfrac{\beta}{L} t^{2}$
\choice $I(t)=\dfrac{\beta}{3 L} t^{3}$
\choice $I(t)=\dfrac{\beta}{L} t^{2} \sin (\omega t)$
\end{choices}\end{questions}
