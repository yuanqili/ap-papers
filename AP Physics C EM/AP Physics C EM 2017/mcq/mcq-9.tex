A copper rod of resistance $R$ is in electrical contact with a frictionless U-shaped rail of width $L$ and negligible resistance. The rod is pulled to the right at a constant velocity $\vec{v}$. A magnetic field $\vec{B}$ is directed into the page, as shown in the figure above. Under these conditions, the electric power dissipated in the rod is $P$. If the velocity of the rod is doubled and the magnetic field strength is reduced by half, the power dissipated in the rod is
