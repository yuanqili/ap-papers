% Multiple Choice Question 22
\question
What is the potential difference across capacitor $C_{1}$?

\begin{oneparchoices}
    \choice $3.0 \unit{V}$
    \choice $4.0 \unit{V}$
    \choice $6.0 \unit{V}$
    \choice $8.0 \unit{V}$
    \choice $12 \unit{V}$
\end{oneparchoices}

% Multiple Choice Question 23
\question
One of the capacitors is removed from the circuit and isolated. While it still holds all of its charge, a piece of ceramic with dielectric constant of 2 is inserted and completely fills the space between the plates. $U_{i}$ is the energy stored in the capacitor before the dielectric was inserted, and $U_{f}$ is the energy stored in the capacitor after the dielectric was inserted. What is the ratio $U_{f}/U_{i}$?

\begin{oneparchoices}
    \choice $1/4$
    \choice $1/2$
    \choice $1/1$
    \choice $2/1$
    \choice $4/1$
