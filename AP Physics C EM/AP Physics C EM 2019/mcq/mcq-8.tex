\question
Two conducting plates hold equal and opposite charges that create an electric field of magnitude $E = 95 \unit{N/C}$ that is directed to the right, as shown in the figure above. Points $\mathrm{A}$ and $\mathrm{B}$ are $0.75 \unit{cm}$ apart with $\mathrm{A}$ closer to the positive plate. A proton is released from rest at point $A$. What is the kinetic energy of the proton when it reaches point B?
