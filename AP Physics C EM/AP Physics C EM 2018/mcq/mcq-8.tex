\question
A parallel plate capacitor with air between the plates is charged and then disconnected from the source of emf. If the space between the plates is now filled with a dielectric, what happens to the capacitance of the capacitor and the magnitude of the electric field between the plates?

\tabto{0.75cm} \underline{Capacitance}
\tabto{3.50cm} \underline{Magnitude of the Electric Field}

\begin{choices}
