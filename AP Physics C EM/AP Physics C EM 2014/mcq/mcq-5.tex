Two particles with the same speed $v_{0}$ enter a region of uniform magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ directed into the page and are initially traveling perpendicular to $\mathbf{B}$, as shown above. Particle $Y$ has charge $-Q$ and mass $M$; particle $Z$ has charge $+Q$ and mass $2 M$. Which of the following pairs of paths shown is possible for the subsequent motion of the particles?

\tabto{0.75cm}{Particle $Y$}
\tabto{4.00cm}{Particle $Z$}\\
\tabto{0.75cm}\underline{$-Q, M$}
\tabto{4.00cm}\underline{$-Q, 2M$}
