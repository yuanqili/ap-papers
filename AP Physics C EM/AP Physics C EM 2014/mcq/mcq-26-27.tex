A circular conducting ring of area $0.20 \unit{m^2}$ lies in the plane of the page inside a spatially uniform magnetic field that is perpendicular to the page. The field changes smoothly from $1.5 \unit{T}$ directed out of the page, as shown above on the left, to $1.5 \unit{T}$ directed into the page, as shown above on the right. The change takes place at a constant rate during a total time interval of $0.6 \unit{s}$.
