A conducting rod of length $L$ is pivoted at point $P$. The other end slides with negligible friction on a conducting rail in the shape of a circular arc. The plane of the rail and rod is perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field of magnitude $B$ directed into the page, as shown in the figure above. The rod rotates counterclockwise at constant angular velocity $\omega$. Assume that all the resistance of the circuit is contained in the resistor $R$. Which of the following describes the induced current in the view shown?
