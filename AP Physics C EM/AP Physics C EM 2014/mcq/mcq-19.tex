\begin{questions}\setcounter{question}{18}\question
The circuit shown above consists of a battery of emf $\mathcal{E}$ and internal resistance $r$, a resistor $R$, an inductor $L$, and a switch $S$, initially in position 1. After the current $i$ in the inductor reaches its maximum value $I_{0}, S$ is switched instantaneously from position 1 to position 2 at time $t=0$. Subsequent variation of $i$ with $t$ is best represented by which of the following graphs?
