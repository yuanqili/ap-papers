Two identical spheres are $10.0 \unit{cm}$ apart and carry equal charges that create a force of $4.00 \times 10^{-8} \unit{N}$ on each. Their diameters are much smaller than their separation distance.
First one sphere is completely discharged. The spheres are then moved together until they touch, and finally they are moved to $5.00 \unit{cm}$ apart. The new force between the spheres is
