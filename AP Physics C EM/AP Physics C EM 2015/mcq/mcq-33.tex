Two square loops of thin metal wire are positioned on the horizontal $x y$-plane in a magnetic field $\vec{B}$ that is directed upward through the loops at an angle $\theta$ with the vertical z-axis, as shown in the figure above. The small loop has side length $a$. The large loop has side length $b$. The magnetic flux in the space between the loops is
