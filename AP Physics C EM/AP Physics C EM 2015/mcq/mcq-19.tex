A uniform magnetic field $\vec{B}$ is directed out of the page, as represented above. A loop of wire of area $0.8 \unit{m^2}$ is in the plane of the page. At a certain instant, the field has a magnitude of $5.0 \unit{T}$ and is decreasing at the rate of $0.5 \unit{T/s}$. The magnitude of the induced emf in the wire loop at this instant is most nearly
