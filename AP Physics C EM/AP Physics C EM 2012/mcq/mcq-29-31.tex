A circuit consists of a resistor $R$, an inductor $L$, and an open switch $S$ connected in series with a battery. The switch is then closed at time $t=0$.

% Multiple Choice Question 29
\begin{questions}\setcounter{question}{28}\question
If the current in the circuit is $I$ at time $t$, what energy is stored in the circuit in addition to that stored in the battery?

\begin{oneparchoices}
\choice $L I$
\choice $I^{2} R$
\choice $\dfrac{1}{2} L I^{2}$
\choice $L I+I^{2} R$
\choice $\dfrac{1}{2} L I^{2}+I^{2} R$
\end{oneparchoices}\end{questions}

% Multiple Choice Question 31
\begin{questions}\setcounter{question}{30}\question
