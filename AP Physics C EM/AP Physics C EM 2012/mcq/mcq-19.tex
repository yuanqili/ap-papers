\begin{questions}\setcounter{question}{18}\question
Two objects on a horizontal frictionless surface each have charge $+Q$ and each are fixed in place on the $x$ axis at the same distance $d$ from the origin as shown in the figure above. A particle of charge $-q$ constrained to move along the $y$ axis is released from rest. After release, the particle will
