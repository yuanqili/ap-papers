\begin{questions}\setcounter{question}{31}\question
A capacitor of capacitance $C_{1}$ is charged and then connected to another initially uncharged capacitor of capacitance $C_{2}=2 C_{1}$, as shown above, with the switch $S$ in the open position. When $S$ is closed and the system comes to equilibrium, which of the following is true of the charges on the capacitors and the potential differences across them?

\tabto{0.75cm}\underline{Charge}
\tabto{4.00cm}\underline{Potential Difference}

\begin{choices}
\choice $Q_{1} = \dfrac{1}{2} Q_{2}$ \tabto{3.25cm} $V_{1} = \dfrac{1}{2} V_{2}$
\choice $Q_{1} = \dfrac{1}{2} Q_{2}$ \tabto{3.25cm} $V_{1} = V_{2}$
\choice $Q_{1} = Q_{2}$              \tabto{3.25cm} $V_{1} = V_{2}$
