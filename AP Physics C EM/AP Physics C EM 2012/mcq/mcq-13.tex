\begin{questions}\setcounter{question}{12}\question
A uniform magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ of magnitude $1.2 \unit{T}$ passes through a rectangular loop of wire, which measures $0.10 \unit{m}$ by $0.20 \unit{m}$. The field is oriented $30^{\circ}$ with respect to the plane of the loop, as shown above. What is the magnetic flux through the loop?
