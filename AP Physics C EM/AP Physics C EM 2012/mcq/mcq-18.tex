\begin{questions}\setcounter{question}{17}\question
Two particles each with a charge $-Q$ are fixed a distance $L$ apart as shown above. Each particle experiences a net electric force $F$. A particle with a charge $+q$ is now fixed midway between the original two particles. As a result, the net electric force experienced by each negatively charged particle is reduced to $F / 2$. The value of $q$ is
